This program is a vector calculator, where it calculates the magnitude of 2 vectors and outputs the magnitude of the resultant vector.
The program receives 2 main inputs: the magnitude of the first and the second vector.
If the 2 vectors aren't perpendicular, the user can input the angle of the 2 vectors to determine the magnitude of the resultant vector.
The program then outputs the magnitude of the resultant vectors based off of the input the user gives.
